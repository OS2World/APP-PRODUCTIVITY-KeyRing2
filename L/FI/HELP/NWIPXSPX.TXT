!TOPIC 1925 NWIPXSPX

There are two types of NetWare advanced peer-to-peer messaging services.
Datagram services are implemented using IPX, and session services are
implemented using SPX.

IPX stands for Internetwork Packet eXchange protocol. It is Novell's
implementation of the Internetwork Datagram Packet Protocol designed by
Xerox. Using it applications can communicate directly with other
workstations, servers or devices.

The following routines relate to IPX services:

  1956IPXServicesAvail
!WRAP

NetWare also implements a high level node-to-node communication
facility called SPX (Sequenced Packet eXchange Protocol). SPX is
based on the Sequenced Packet Protocol defined by Xerox.

Building upon IPX services, SPX provides a guaranteed delivery system
for packets of data. SPX automatically selects appropriate timeout and
retransmission counts based on the physical characteristics of the network
hardware. Hence, applications using SPX need not be concerned with the
details of the guaranteed delivery system.

A receiver of SPX messages must make more than one event control block
available to handle incoming messages. The SPX routines in the NWIPXSPX
unit make this easy by automatically managing a pool of event control
blocks. When an application establishes an SPX connection, it simply
specifies the number of event control blocks and the maximum size of each
data packet.

The following routines relate to SPX services:

Please note that many of the types described above need not be accessed
directly by an application. Descriptions are included to illustrate the
hierarchy of information leading to the high level types passed as
parameters to the NWIPXSPX routines.

Although the data types refer to standard Pascal identifiers, you should
know that NetWare reverses the byte ordering of almost all Word and
LongInt fields. That is, the most significant byte is stored first instead
of last. The high level routines in NWIPXSPX reverse the order as and when
necessary, for example when storing a socket number you pass as a
parameter.
;
;-------------------------------------------------------------------
!TOPIC 1927 IPXAllNodes
!NOINDEX
const
  IPXAllNodes : PhysicalNodeAddress = ($FF,$FF,$FF,$FF,$FF,$FF);

When passed as a node address to an IPX send routine, this value indicates
that the message should be sent to all nodes. Novell warns that not all
hardware configurations support this special address. Even when it is
supported, only nodes that are listening through the specified socket will
actually receive the message. A destination address of IPXAllNodes is not
allowed for SPX messages.
;
;-------------------------------------------------------------------
!TOPIC 1928 IPXMaxDataSize
!NOINDEX
const
  IPXMaxDataSize = 546;

The maximum number of bytes of data in an IPX packet. More modern networks
can support a larger IPX packet size (and hence a larger amount of data),
but the 1925NWIPXSPX unit does not provide a means of determining whether such
a network is available. In addition, some inter-network routers do not
support large IPX packets.
;

!TOPIC 1929 SPXMaxDataSize

const
  SPXMaxPoolCount = 16;

The maximum number of event control blocks that can be actively listening
for SPX messages in a 'listen pool'. Although this value can be increased,
it generally does not make sense to do so.
;
;-------------------------------------------------------------------
!TOPIC 1931 SPXRetryCount
!NOINDEX
const
  SPXRetryCount : Byte = 0;

The retry count for SPX operations. A value of zero indicates that SPX
should use its predetermined count; any other value is used explicitly.
;
;-------------------------------------------------------------------
!TOPIC 1932 SPXWatchDog
!NOINDEX
const
  SPXWatchDog : Boolean = False;

Specifies whether to activate the SPX Watchdog process. If SPXWatchDog is
True, then an SPX connection uses a special monitor feature to ensure that
this connection stays active. Essentially, the SPX driver sends small
packets regularly to the partner to test whether the partner is still
present or not. If the connection is broken, 1966SPXPacketReceived returns
True with a special packet data type.

Used by IPX to manage a message. CheckSum is used internally for error
control. Len is the length of the transmitted packet, including the header
and data. Valid lengths range from 30 to 576. TransportControl is used
internally. Destination and Source specify the internetwork addresses of
the receiver and sender of the message, respectively. TipxHeader fields
are managed for you by the 1925NWIPXSPX unit and by the IPX driver itself, so
you will use them for read-only purposes, if at all. The field you will
reference most often is Source to find out who sent a particular message.

The control block for an IPX event; an event is the process of sending or
listening for a message. Although the 1925NWIPXSPX unit manages the contents
of this record for you, a little description might clarify how it works.

ESRAddress holds the address of an "event service routine" (ESR). If the
pointer isn't Nil, the IPX driver will call the routine it points to when
an event is complete. This forms the basis for interrupt driven messaging
protocols. If you want to use an event service routine, write a procedure
of type 1937IPXEventServiceRoutine and pass it to the 1943IPXAllocEventRec
routine. This takes care of setting up the ESRAddress field for you.

The InUse field is initialized to zero before submitting an event control
block to IPX. IPX sets the field to a non-zero value to specify the
event's status. When the field is zero again, the event is complete.
Once an event is complete, CompletionCode specifies its outcome. See the
1947IPXEventComplete function for a list of the possible values.

SocketNumber is the socket being used for communication.

ImmediateAddress holds the address of a node within the current network.
If the message originated from, or is destined for, another network,
ImmediateAddress holds the address of the internetwork bridge node. The
NWIPXSPX unit initializes this field when it builds an IPX event control
block.

A data packet can be composed of several fragments (see 1935TipxFragment). The first fragment
must always begin with a 1934TipxHeader. Remaining fragments can hold the
actual packet data. The NWIPXSPX unit always uses two fragments, one for
the header and the other for the data. The sum of the Size fields of all
the individual fragments must not exceed 576 bytes.
;

!TOPIC 1937 IPXEventServiceRoutine

type
  IPXEventServiceRoutine = procedure (FromAES : boolean;
                                      IPXEvent : PipxEventRec);

Procedure prototype for a Pascal event service routine (ESR). An ESR is
called by the IPX driver when an event completes. The FromAES boolean
defines whether the event completion came from the Asynchronous Event
Scheduler (AES) or not. In your programming this will normally be False.
IPXEvent is a pointer to the management record whose event was completed.

Your ESR must be extremely short and fast because it is called with
interrupts off (do not turn interrupts on because the code that calls your
ESR is not reentrant), and it cannot call any DOS or BIOS services.

Generally you will only use an ESR on listen type events, in which case
you can copy the message received onto a queue and resubmit the listen
event. In Windows applications, another good suggestion is to send the
main application a message to say that the listen event completed.

The ESR routine is installed by passing it as a parameter to
1943IPXAllocEventRec.

the fields. The ECB field describes the message itself with pointers to
its contents and information about message routing and status. The Header
field describes the source and destination of the message. The Next field
enables the NWIPXSPX routines to form an internal linked list of
TipxEventRec variables, and the UserESR field is the event service routine
that is called when the event completes. The routines in the NWIPXSPX unit
initialize and maintain all fields for you.

The high level type used by 1925NWIPXSPX to manage SPX messages. A variable of
this type must be allocated by 1958SPXAllocEventRec by the calling program and
passed to the various SPX message routines.

The ECB and Header fields are used to establish and terminate a
connection. The AmConnected field is initially False and is set to True by
the NWIPXSPX unit when a connection is established, in which case the
ConnID field contains the connection ID for this SPX session. When the
connection is broken either by calling 1970SPXTerminateConn or 1957SPXAbortConn or
by some other problem, the NWIPXSPX routines set the AmConnected flag to
False again and clear the connection number field.

The Next field enables the NWIPXSPX unit to maintain a linked list of
TspxEventRecs. The PacketSize field is the buffer size that you passed to
the SPXAllocEventRec routines. The PoolCount and QueueCount fields are the
numbers of listen buffers in the pool and the number of listen buffers
that have received a message and are awaiting processing. The Pool field
is the array of listen buffers for this event management record. The Queue
field is an array of indexes of listen buffers that are awaiting
processing.

The routines in the NWIPXSPX unit initialize and maintain the values in
the TspxEventRec, you should not alter any values yourself.

Used by the 1925NWIPXSPX unit to manage a pool of listen buffers for an SPX
connection. A single listen buffer is a variable of this type; the
1939TspxEventRec variable allocated by 1958SPXAllocEventRec tracks an array of
these buffers. The PoolData field is just large enough to contain a buffer
of the size specified during a call to SPXAllocEventRec. The PoolECB field
is an IPX event control block that listens for incoming SPX messages, the
PoolHeader field is an SPX header defining the source and destination of
the SPX message.

The data structure returned by 1964SPXGetConnStatus. The most important result
returned by this function is its return code, which indicates whether the
connection still exists. The information in the structure itself may be
useful in rare situations. 1925NWIPXSPX swaps byte ordering as necessary to
bring the structure to PC standards before returning the structure. Here
is a brief summary of the fields.

State can take on four values: 1 - waiting to receive an establish
connection packet; 2 - attempting to establish a connection by sending
establish packets; 3 - connection established; 4 - the remote has
terminated its half of the connection.

If bit 1 of Flag is set (i.e. (Flag and $02)<>0), the SPX watchdog is
monitoring the connection. The SPX watchdog watches for connections that
aren't used for a long period of time. The other bits of this field are
used internally by SPX.

SourceConn and DestConn are the connection ID numbers of the local and
remote nodes respectively.

SequenceNum and AckNum are packet numbers assigned internally by SPX.
These numbers increase sequentially from zero and wrap back to zero when
they reach 0xFFFF. SequenceNum is the number of the next packet the local
station will send. AckNum is the number of the next packet the local
station expects to receive.

AllocNum is the highest packet number the local station can receive given
the number of available listening IPX event control blocks. This number is
increased as the local station adds (or reactivates) control blocks in the
listen pool. SPX uses this field to implement flow control.
RemoteAckNum and RemoteAllocNum are analogous to AckNum and AllocNum, but
they refer to the packet numbers the remote station expects to receive
from the local station.

ConnSocket is the socket number the local station is using to send and
receive SPX packets. ImmediateAdd is the address of a node on the current
network. If the entire connection is on one network, ImmediateAdd is the
remote station. Otherwise, it is the address of a bridge device.

Destination is the complete address of the remote station, including the
socket number that it is using to send and receive SPX packets.

RetransmitCount indicates the number of times since SPX was loaded that
SPX has attempted to retransmit an unacknowledged packet before
determining that the remote station has become unreachable.

EstimatedRoundTripDelay is the number of clock ticks that SPX waits before
assuming that a packet is lost and retransmitting. RetransmittedPackets is
the number of retransmitted packets that were acknowledged by the remote
station. SuppressedPackets is the number of packets the local station has
discarded because they were duplicates of previously received packets or
because they were outside of the allowable packet number range.

You must allocate an IPX event record  prior to sending or

Cancel any pending IPX event.

After an event is successfully cancelled, the application can reuse the
event variable IPXEvent. If you call 1947IPXEventComplete after cancelling an
event, it returns True and a CompletionCode of $FC.

A status code is returned in the function result:

!NOWRAP

  $F9  Event was active but couldn't cancel it.
  $FF  Event was not active.

!TOPIC 1946 IPXCloseSocket
!NOINDEX
procedure 1925NWIPXSPX.IPXCloseSocket(Socket : Word);

Close the specified socket.

Closing a socket automatically cancels any pending messages that are
associated with the socket. Any further incoming packets are ignored.
Attempting to close a socket that is not open has no effect.

Transient (non-TSR) applications must close all their sockets before
returning to DOS. Even if the sockets were opened with the Forever flag
set to False, there exists a small window of time after the application
has halted and before the IPX manager can close the socket when an
incoming packet might cause a system crash. It is best to define an exit
procedure that closes all open sockets no matter how the program
terminates.

If you are using event service routines, note that IPXCloseSocket cannot
be called within the service routine.

                          var CompletionCode : Byte) : Boolean;

Return the status of a pending IPX event.

IPXEvent is the event to check. When IPXEventComplete returns True, the
event is complete. In this case, CompletionCode returns the status of the
event. If IPXEventComplete returns False, the value of CompletionCode is
undefined.

Call IPXEventComplete after submitting an IPX event with 1955IPXSend or
1951IPXListen. If either function was called with the WaitForCompletion flag
set to True, then IPXEventComplete is guaranteed to return True on the
first call. Otherwise, the program should poll IPXEventComplete until it
returns True. In the meantime, the application can continue to do other
work.

Each call to IPXEventComplete generates a call to 1954IPXRelinquish, which
gives the IPX driver an opportunity to service pending events. If the
application spends a significant amount of time between calls to
IPXEventComplete, it should call IPXRelinquish regularly to assure that
incoming packets are detected.

CompletionCode can return several values, including:

!NOWRAP
;!TABLE
  $00  Packet was sent or received successfully.
  $FC  Send or listen request was cancelled.

Return the internetwork address of the calling workstation.

The network number and physical node address of the caller are returned by
this function. The network number is returned in hi-lo order, which is the
format expected by other functions to which the address is passed. The
third member of the 1461IPXAddress type, the Socket, is not initialized by
this call. The functions to which an IPXAddress variable is passed do not
expect Socket to be initialized.

                   DataPacket : PPacket) : Byte;

Initialize IPX data structures to receive a packet, and submit the event
to IPX.

The structure pointed to by IPXEvent is initialized by IPXListen; it
maintains all the information required for managing the message. The
caller must specify a Socket number for the transmission. Sender and
receiver must agree on a socket number. IPXListen will open the socket
if it isn't already open.

When WaitForCompletion is False, IPXListen returns immediately after
submitting the request to listen. In this case, the calling application
can continue with other tasks, but it must poll the 1947IPXEventComplete
function to determine when the event is complete. If WaitForCompletion is
True, IPXListen itself polls until the event is complete. The completion
code returned by IPXEventComplete indicates whether a message was actually
received.

MaxPacketSize specifies the maximum number of bytes to receive, not
including the header information managed internally by IPXListen. The
largest allowable packet size is 546 bytes (1928IPXMaxDataSize). DataPacket is
a pointer to a variable of any type, as long as the variable is large
enough to hold at least the number of bytes specified by MaxPacketSize.
This DataPacket buffer must have been allocated by 1944IPXAllocPacket.

Open a socket for use by IPX or SPX.

Sender and receiver must agree on a socket number in order to communicate.
Sockets numbered from $4000 to $7FFF are available for use by any
application.

When Forever is True, the socket remains open until explicitly closed,
even after the current program terminates. Otherwise, the IPX driver
closes it automatically when the program ends. Setting Forever True would
be useful for a TSR that requires IPX services.

The 1955IPXSend and 1951IPXListen routines open the requested socket when they are
called, if necessary. Thus IPXOpenSocket might be most useful for
determining that a socket can be opened before an application proceeds too
far.

Even though the IPX driver automatically closes sockets when Forever is
set False, it is still recommended that the application explicitly close
its own sockets.

This function works like 1952IPXOpenSocket, but it returns a socket number
instead of having one passed to it. The returned socket is any valid
available socket found by the IPX driver. The difficulty in using this
routine is that the socket number must usually be communicated to the

procedure 1925NWIPXSPX.IPXRelinquish;

Temporarily relinquish application control to the IPX driver.

This procedure serves one of two purposes, depending on whether it is
invoked from a non-dedicated file server or a workstation. On a server,
this function temporarily suspends the calling process so that the server
program gets CPU resources immediately. Similarly, on a workstation, the
NetWare shell gets temporary control during which it can check for
incoming and outgoing messages.

This procedure should be called frequently while an application waits for
an IPX or SPX event to complete. 1947IPXEventComplete automatically calls
IPXReliquish. However, if an application performs significant processing
between calls to IPXEventComplete, it is wise to call IPXRelinquish
regularly so that the driver can process incoming messages.

                 DataPacket : PPacket) : Byte;

Initialize IPX data structures to send a packet, and submit the event to
IPX.

The event record pointed to by IPXEvent is initialized by IPXSend and
maintains all the information required for managing the message. The
IPXEvent variable must be obtained by calling 1943IPXAllocEventRec.

The caller must initialize Receiver to specify where the packet should go.
The caller must also specify a Socket number for the transmission. Sender
and receiver must agree on a socket number. IPXSend opens the socket if
it isn't already open.

When WaitForCompletion is False, IPXSend returns immediately after
submitting the request to send. In this case, the calling application can
continue with other tasks, but it must poll the 1947IPXEventComplete function
to determine when the event is complete. If WaitForCompletion is True,
IPXSend itself polls until the event is complete. Because IPX messages are
not confirmed by the receiver, it's generally fast and safe to pass True
to allow the send to finish before IPXSend returns. If WaitForCompletion
is True, the status of the send is returned in the function result;
otherwise call IPXEventComplete to determine the status.

DataPacketSize specifies the number of bytes to send, not including the
header information managed internally by IPXSend. The largest allowable
packet size is 546 bytes. DataPacket is a pointer to a variable of any
type, as long as the variable holds at least the number of bytes specified
by DataPacketSize. The DataPacket buffer must be obtained by calling
1944IPXAllocPacket.

Abruptly terminate an existing SPX connection.

SPXAbortConn does not notify the connection partner of the decision to
break the connection. The partner will eventually discover that the
connection is no longer valid when it sends a packet or attempts to
terminate the connection. If the connection was established with the SPX
Watchdog feature (see the SPXWatchdog typed constant earlier in this
section), the partner will receive a failed connection message the next
time the monitor tests the connection.

This routine is designed to unilaterally break a connection when a serious
error condition is encountered. Under most circumstances, 1970SPXTerminateConn

Allocate an SPX event record and associated buffers.

NumECBs specifies the number of message buffers, each of size
MaxPacketSize bytes, allocated for the SPX event record. NumECBs must
always be at least equal to two. NumECBs can be no more than
1930SPXMaxPoolCount, which defaults to 16. Because SPX has automatic flow
control, the choice of NumECBs is primarily a matter of performance.

MaxPacketSize must be in the range from 1 to 1929SPXMaxDataSize (534).
If NumECBs or MaxPacketSize is outside of the valid range, or if there is
insufficient memory to allocate the structure, SPXAllocEventRec returns
nil.

This function returns a number in the range from zero to NumECBs (as
passed to 1958SPXAllocEventRec). If no buffers are listening, all of the

                          WaitForCompletion : Boolean) : Byte;

Establish an SPX connection with a listening partner.

An initial message is sent to the partner's internetwork address in an
attempt to create an SPX connection. If the partner responds correctly,
then a communication channel is established. The partner must call
1965SPXListenForConn in order to establish its side of the link.

The caller must initialize Receiver to specify the partner's address.
The caller must also specify two socket numbers for the connection: the
first socket is used by the local program (LocalSocket) to communicate
with its SPX driver and the other is used by the remote program to
communicate with *its* SPX driver. These two socket numbers must be
different. The sender and receiver must agree on the two socket numbers.
SPXEstablishConn opens the local socket if it isn't already open.

When WaitForCompletion is False, SPXEstablishConn returns immediately
after submitting the request to establish a connection. In this case, the
calling application can continue with other tasks, but it must poll the
1962SPXEventComplete function to determine when the event is complete. If
WaitForCompletion is True, SPXEstablishConn itself polls until the event
is complete.

The SPX connection ID eventually established by this function is stored in
the SPXEvent variable.

A status code is returned in the function result:

Poll the status of an SPX event to determine when the event is complete.

This routine is necessary because SPX messaging services are asynchronous.
When an application calls 1961SPXEstablishConn, 1965SPXListenForConn, or 1968SPXSend
and the WaitForCompletion parameter is False, SPX submits a message header
to a queue and returns immediately.

Only later, when the message has made its way to the receiver and a
confirmation is received, is the event considered complete. At that time,
the caller can check the outcome, e.g., whether the connection was
established or the message was successfully sent. SPXEventComplete returns
True when the specified event is complete; False otherwise. It is never
safe to call one of these functions using the same SPXEvent variable until
the previous event is complete.

When SPXEventComplete returns True, CompletionCode returns a status code:

!NOWRAP
;!TABLE
  $00  Event completed successfully.
  $EC  Connection terminated by remote partner.
  $ED  Target failed to answer.

  $FD  Malformed packet.
  $FE  The socket table is full.
  $FF  Underlying socket not open. (NETWARE internal error)
!WRAP

Each call to SPXEventComplete generates a call to 1954IPXRelinquish, which
gives the IPX driver an opportunity to service pending IPX and SPX events.
If the application spends a significant amount of time between calls to
SPXEventComplete, it should call IPXRelinquish regularly to assure that
incoming packets are detected.

This function can be called after calling 1961SPXEstablishConn even if this
event have not completed successfully. It can also be called after a

Listen for an SPX connection from a sending partner.

This function is the counterpart of the 1961SPXEstablishConn function. For a
connection to be established, one side must listen with SPXListenForConn,
and the other side must call with SPXEstablishConn.

The caller must specify a socket number (LocalSocket) for the connection.
This socket is used for communicating with the local SPX driver, and must
be the same socket that the partner specifies in the RemoteSocket
parameter when it calls SPXEstablishConn. SPXListenForConn opens the
specified socket if it isn't already open.

When WaitForCompletion is False, SPXListenForConn returns immediately
after submitting the request to establish a connection. In this case, the
calling application can continue with other tasks, but it must poll the
1962SPXEventComplete function to determine when the event is complete. If
WaitForCompletion is True, SPXListenForConn itself polls until the event
is complete.

If you pass True for WaitForCompletion and SPXListenForConn returns zero
(i.e. successful), then it automatically stores the SPX connection ID in
the SPXEvent variable in the ConnID field. If you pass False so that
SPXListenForConn returns immediately, a subsequent successful call to
SPXEventComplete stores the connection ID in the same field.

A status code is returned in the function result:

  $EF  Local connection table is full.

                           var DataPtr : Pointer) : Boolean;

Return True if an SPX packet was received.

An application that is waiting to receive SPX messages must call this
routine in a loop. SPXPacketReceived checks the internal queue of received
messages and returns True when the queue is not empty. The queue is
updated in the background by an SPX event service routine.

When SPXPacketReceived returns True, the Index parameter is set to the
internal index number of the listen buffer holding the received message.
Your application doesn't need to use this number except to pass it to
1967SPXReactivateECB, which indicates that the application has processed the
message and the listen buffer can be reused by SPX.

The variable pointed to by DataType is also initialized when a message is
received. DataType always contains the value zero for messages sent by
your application. Non-zero values indicate a message sent by SPX itself.

The variable pointed to by CompletionCode holds the final status of the
IPX event record used to manage this particular packet. Any non-zero value
indicates that there was an error receiving the packet.

The variable pointed to by DataPtr gets a pointer to the actual data
buffer. Data buffers were allocated when 1958SPXAllocEventRec was called, and
DataPtr returns one of these pointers. You can pass the address of any
pointer in this position, and then use that pointer to process the
received message.

After an application receives a message (via 1966SPXPacketReceived) and
completely processes the message, it must call SPXReactivateECB to inform
SPX that the listen buffer can be reused.

The Index parameter must be the same value that was returned by

SPXReactivateECB does nothing.

                 DataPacketSize : Word; DataPacket : PPacket) : Byte;

Send a data packet using SPX services.

SPXEvent must have been allocated previously by a call to
1958SPXAllocEventRec, and an SPX connection must have been established by a
successful (completed) call to 1961SPXEstablishConn or 1965SPXListenForConn. The DataPacket
pointer must have been allocated by calling 1944IPXAllocPacket.

The packet is any user-defined data type up to 534 bytes in size. Pass the
size of the packet as the DataPacketSize parameter. The actual length of
the message is not known to the receiver, so if packets of varying sizes
are sent, the application should store the packet length somewhere within
the packet itself. The packet length should not exceed the maximum size
specified by the receiver when it called SPXAllocEventRec.

The SPXSend event is asynchronous in the same sense that establishing the
connection is. Therefore, if WaitForCompletion is False, an SPXSend must
be followed by repeated calls to 1962SPXEventComplete. Similarly, the
DataPacket buffer must remain static until the SPXSend is complete.

You must call this function before using any of the other SPX functions.

SPXServicesAvail returns True if SPX is available. In this case it also

SPXTerminateConn sends a packet to the other end of the connection
indicating that the connection should be broken. SPX automates the
receiver's acknowledgement of the message and also completes the
disconnection process. The associated connection ID is returned to the
free pool.

SPXTerminateConn internally waits for the local SPX driver to report that
the connection was successfully terminated. Then the routine closes the
local socket that was being used for communicating to the SPX driver and
clears out the relevant fields in the SPXEvent variable. On return from
SPXTerminateConn, the SPXEvent variable can either be reused to establish
another connection, or can be freed by calling 1963SPXFreeEventRec.
