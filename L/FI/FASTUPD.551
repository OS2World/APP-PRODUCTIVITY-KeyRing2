This file summarizes the changes made between B-Tree Filer versions
5.50 and 5.51.


New Features and Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of B-Tree Filer has been released for three main reasons:

   1. Delphi compatibility
   2. Revised NetWare access units
   3. Minor bug fixes and other sundry items.


1. Delphi compatibility
-----------------------

B-Tree Filer and its ancillary units will now compile with the Delphi
1.0 compiler.

We have included a browser for Delphi. The browser is a normal Delphi
component and can be installed onto the palette. Documentation for the
browser is found in an on-line help file; this is also installable
into the Delphi IDE. The browser is based on the LOWBROWS, MEDBROWS
and HIBROWS set, and so for more documentation you can peruse the
manuals under WBROWSER. Details on installation are in the READ.1ST
file.

The FILER.MAK make file has been changed so that you can specify
Delphi as the compiler, in which case the make file will use DCC.EXE.


2. Revised NetWare access units
-------------------------------

The NetWare units, especially NWBASE.PAS, have gone through a few
revisions since version 5.50. These changes have come about because
of incompatibilities between adapters and networks, faults in the
Novell Client API documentation, and bugs. The changes are too
numerous but can be summarized as follows:

  - NWBASE no longer initializes through its initialization block.
    The first time a NWBASE routine is called, it will cause an
    initialization routine to run; the best routine to call would be
    nwShellType.
  - Under Windows, VLM support is now provided through Novell's
    NWCALLS.DLL. The linkage is through a dynamic link, not a static
    one; this enables an application to be NetWare aware, and yet run
    if the NetWare DLLs are not present.
  - The TTS support through NCP was broken for certain adapters and
    drivers (we *think* we have got it right now, but we'd like
    feedback if you have problems with nwTTSEnd).


3. Minor bug fixes and other sundry items
-----------------------------------------

BASESUPP  Return value from GlobalDOSAlloc was assumed to be positive.

NWFILE    Doubly defined error code $7F23; nwErrNoFileName is now
          $7F24.

NWBASE    Windows VLM calls must go through NWCALLS.DLL

NWSEMA    The $6F Wait On Semaphore API call doesn't work; all
          semaphore calls now use $20.

FILER     BTOpenFileBlock left FlagSetReadLocked uninitialised.

NWFILE    Locking routines wouldn't work 100% with NETX/Windows

FILER     TimeOut for a lock is wrong if SupportVLM is defined

NWBASE    Under Windows NWCALLS.DLL had to be present; now the DLL
          is used in a dynamic sense

TTSFILER  nwTTSEnd should be called after BTUnlockFileBlock

SHARE     Pmode/Win: ShareInstalled returns false instead of true

SHARE     Pmode/Win: IBMPCLanLoaded doesn't use real mode intr

SHARE     GetMachineName used bogus address in call

NWFILE    Added nwGetDirRights--get effective directory rights

NWTTS     TTS calls fail with some adapters under IPX.COM/Windows

SHARE     RedirectDevice was using the wrong string conversion

OOFILER   Unlock doesn't preserve IsamError

NETBIOS   DPMI Post Event routines only supported one NCB

NWBASE    Crash if Filer's ExitProc executed after NWBASE's

NWBASE    Uppercasing routine *must* be compiled with $P-
