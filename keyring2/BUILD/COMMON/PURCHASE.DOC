Tip:  If you have an account with BMT Micro, Inc., put your PIN number
====  in the credit card field.   (For more info on opening an account
      with BMT Micro, see the form account.doc in this archive)

1.  The BMT Micro, Inc. purchase applet requires that you be connected
    to the internet to submit an online order.

2.  Your online order is encrypted prior to being sent.  We make no
    claims about the ability of another party to intercept and decipher
    your online order.  In fact, the chances of an online order being
    intercepted is exactly the same as any other email message you send.
    The encryption routine does provide an extra layer of security.  I
    personally would have no problem using this application to send an
    order but if you are really, really concerned about security please
    use our secure web server to place an order at http://www.bmtmicro.com.

3.  When you send an order the program also creates a text file named
    register.frm.   Please print this and save it as a record of your
    order.

4.  If you wish to pay by means other than a credit card the program
    will print an order from suitable for mailing.  The printed order
    form has our mailing address.

5.  The pricing of the products in the list is current as of
    December 29, 1996.  If for any reason there is a price difference
    between the current price and the listed price we will contact you
    via email prior to processing the order.   Under no circumstances
    will we bill you any amount higher than is quoted on the order form.

6.  We have made every attempt to include all OS/2 products distributed
    by BMT Micro, Inc.   We are constantly adding programs, if the
    product you wish to purchase is not listed please contact us via
    email at bmt@bmtmicro.com or contact us using any of the methods
    outlined in the bmtmicro.inf catalog.

7.  BMT Micro, Inc. makes no claims for this purchase applet.  If you
    place an online order and do not hear from us within 24 hours please
    contact us at bmt@bmtmicro.com and we'll check it out.    You can
    expect to hear from us even in the case of declined credit cards or
    orders that cannot be processed for any reason.
