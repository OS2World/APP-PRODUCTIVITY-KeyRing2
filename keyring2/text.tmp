 Revision History   

      v2.1 Sept 2001. This is a major rewrite. Fixed a problem in the 
       2.0 beta release where dropping an icon file on the WWW page 
       caused a program crash. Changed the record expiration date field 
       to a DMY format. Now you can set an absolute expiration date for 
       a record. Fixed a problem in Beta mode that expired database 
       files older than 30 days even if you had a paid up license. Added 
       a copy records feature. You can now copy records between 
       notebook pages. Added more icons and an improved delivery 
       method. The new icon graphics are not so great (grainy) but I can 
       send out improved ones in a later release. Many major credit card 
       icons have been added to the internal list. Send me any other 
       logo graphics files you would like to see added. Added record 
       copy feature to duplicate records to other pages. Removed record 
       sort slider and replaced it with a popup menu item. The slider 
       control was just not working out with most video adapter cards. 
       The upside is that the sort mode names can be longer than 3 
       characters. 

      v2.0 Some major new features have been added! You may now 
       move  records from page to page, and create multiline icon 
       descriptions. KR2 now keeps track of your edits. If you make no 
       changes to the database, KR2 will not re-encrypt the database. 
       This should speed up shutdown of KR2 if you just took a quick 
       peek at a record. Changed the import feature to merge the 
       imported records with any existing ones previously loaded. You 
       may now combine several databases by first exporting them and 
       then importing them back into a single database. You may now 
       drop OS/2 BMP files on the Boss page to change the background 
       graphics. Some people did not like the groovy 1970's tiedye look. 
       Added "Sticky Pages". KR2 remembers the last notebook page you 
       used and jumps  to it when you restart. Added a new feature to 
       registration keys that allows you to demo major upgrades (v1.x, 
       v2.x). Your key will work without nag screens on the version you 
       paid for and all previous versions. The nag screen will appear on 
       major versions greater than the one you are licensed for. The 30 
       day PWX lifetime limitation is removed if you have paid for *any* 
       previous version. Note that minor version upgrades (v2.2, v2.3, ...) 
       are always free. 

      v1.15 Fixed bug that caused gradient background behind buttons 
       to cover only half the window width when running under SDD and 
       recent fixpacks. Added a new menu item to allow copying your 
       username to the clipboard. Fixed a bug that truncated database 
       field data containing an equal sign. This especially affected some 
       complex URLs. 

      v1.14 Added code to prevent tampering with encryption DLLs and 
       use of Blowfish DLL by other programs. Dropped support for DES. 

      v1.13 Added support for drag and drop of BMP file on to the 
       columns in the Setup dialog. This changes the background graphic 
       of the associated notebook page. 

      v1.12 Fixed Import feature. Fixed icon drag and drop on record 
       containers. Added drag/drop of PWX icons on Login screen. You 
       may now drop a PWX file icon on the Database file field. Added 
       file association between KEYRING.EXE and *.PW?. Now you can 
       double click on a PWX file to launch KR2. Fixed some suspect 
       looking portions of the WarpIN installation script. Adding Polish 
       language file to release.   

      v1.11 Internal release.   

      v1.10 Fixed master password amnesia in DES mode. The robot ate 
       my homework... The web page robot created invalid DLLs for DES 
       users.   

      v1.9 Fixed page icon crash bug. If you left-clicked on a page 
       icon and selected cancel on the file dialog, KR2 would crash. 
       Fixed. Added warning message when saving-as password is 
       different from the old password. Added code to prevent orderly 
       program shutdown when user fails to enter a password during 
       Save-As. Fixed WarpIN problem where installing to a directory 
       other than C:\KR2 caused a program crash. WarpIN was ignoring 
       the path change and installing registration key files to C:\KR2 
       instead of the correct user-specified path. The "missing" files 
       caused the crash.   

      v1.8 Added registration keyfile code.   

      v1.7 Internal release. Changed hide button to minimize on main 
       screen.   

      v1.6 Added DES CBC  (Cypher Block Chaining) and Blowfish CBC 
       support.  Cypher Block Chaining further encrypts the database file 
       to remove repetitive blocks of encrypted characters. This makes 
       the files a little harder to crack. Implemented new PWX file format 
       that identifies the type of encryption used and the product version 
       used to create it. This should simplify product improvements in 
       the future. The new file format should be smaller, faster and 
       harder to crack. KR2 can read the old format and will 
       automatically translate the file to the new format. Fixed shutdown 
       bug that caused an error message to pop up if Custom Fonts 
       were turned on. Fixed problem with Record Editor that caused a 
       file called ININAME to appear in the KR2 directory.   

      v1.5 Added a sound file selector field in the Setup dialog. Now 
       you can pick your own WAV or MID file.  We added a couple fun 
       ones to the installer. Try TWILITZN.WAV. Added column name 
       revert feature in Setup dialog. Fixed missing record editor field 
       hints after creating a new PWX. Started work on Blowfish CBC 
       mode and smart PWX file format.   

      v1.4 Completely reworked vast portions of the program to allow 
       further customization of page names and database columns. Now 
       you can move columns around or hide them altogether. Fixed 
       missing virtual language strings. Fixed a bunch of buglets and 
       probably added a few more. Password expiration feature is now 
       working. Added multimedia file play support. Switched to OS/2 
       Netlabs WarpIN Installer.   

      v1.3 Reworked the setup dialog to allow customization of the 
       database column names, Notebook tab names, and page help 
       hints.  Extended the database file to save the page customization. 
       Added multigenerational database file backup. Removed extra task 
       list entries.  Adding automatic record creation upon drag/drop of 
       an icon into a container. Added icon replacement upon drag/drop 
       of an icon on top of an existing record. Added save button to 
       speedbar. Reworked Record Editor and added support for password 
       expiration dates. This feature is not quite finished, so the clock 
       button is temporarily shut off.   

      v1.2 Added Import feature, autosize of controls based on 
       font/language. Improved screen draws. Language selector menu 
       item added. Record data font palette added. Fixed drag/drop fonts. 
       Added custom font checkbox on the setup dialog to speed startup 
       for folks who do not need custom fonts.   

      v1.1 Fixed installer errors, misc small bugs including the 
       edit-crash bug.   

      v1.0 Virgin
