Before You Install KeyRing/2
---------------------------------
   Software Requirements
   ---------------------
   OS/2 Warp 3.0 or Warp 4.0
   WarpIN installer from OS/2 Netlabs

   Optional Software
   -----------------
   Netscape for OS/2 (any version that supports DDE)

   Hardware Requirements
   ---------------------
   486 CPU or better
   32 Mb RAM 
   Sufficient free disk space for installation and database file
   (approx 2.5 Mb)

-------------------------------------------
KeyRing/2 Download Instructions
-------------------------------------------

   If you are downloading using Netscape, remember to hold the Shift key down 
   when you click on the web page download link to KR2.WPI.  If you fail to 
   do so, your screen will fill with junk characters and the file will not 
   be downloaded!

   If you are downloading the demo, read this entire file! There is a missing
   file you must obtain from IDK, Inc. before you will be able to encrypt
   your database!

-------------------------------------------
KeyRing/2 Installation Instructions:
-------------------------------------------

1. Create an empty directory on your hard drive.  Skip to step 4 if you have
   downloaded the installation files from the Internet. 
   
2. Insert KeyRing/2 floppy 1 of 3 into drive A:

3. Open an OS/2 command line session, CD to the new directory and run:

	[C:\emptydir] a:\kr2inst

   KR2INST will ask you to swap disks several times.  Follow the on-screen 
   instructions to completion.  

4. Check your system for an existing installation of WarpIN, the OS/2 
   installer by OS/2 Netlabs.  If WarpIN has already been installed, skip to
   step 6.

5. Either download or unzip C:\emptydir\WarpIN2.ZIP. The latest version of 
   WarpIN can be found at:
	
	http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444vnd/warpin.htm

   The OS/2 Netlabs page can be found at:

	http://www.netlabs.org/

   You may wish to move WarpIN.EXE and its associated files to its own 
   directory. It creates a small database that it needs to access 
   during upgrades and de-installs. 

   Run WarpIN.EXE. 

   This "installs the installer".  WarpIN creates a folder on your desktop.  
   You may drag this folder to your System or Programs folder if you like.

   WarpIN is a generic installer/deinstaller that can be used with products 
   other than KeyRing/2.  You only have to do this step once. 

6. Open the directory folder where you downloaded/extracted the KeyRing/2 
   product files, and double click on KR2.WPI. WarpIN should launch and show 
   you the various packages found in the installation archive file.  

7. If this is an initial installation and you have not yet registered:

	Select the first two packages, "KeyRing/2" and "Demo Registration". 
	Optionally, you may install the "Startup Sounds for KeyRing/2"

   If you have registered (paid) and want to reinstall from floppies or from
   your existing KR2.WPI file:
   
   	Select packages other than the "Demo Registration".  Selecting Demo 
   	will overwrite your key file, and you will have to reinstall it 
   	separately.

8. Click the WarpIN "Next" button and select an Installation directory, if 
   you don't want to use C:\KR2.  You may install on a FAT or HPFS partition.  
   Networked drives are OK.  If you want to use long file names for your 
   files you must use an HPFS partition. Proceed through the WarpIN 
   instructions and finish the installation. WarpIN will create a folder on 
   your desktop and populate it with icons.  

9. If you are installing from floppies, your installation is complete!  Skip 
   to Step 11.

10. If you downloaded the KeyRing/2 product files from the internet, you must
   now contact IDK, Inc. to obtain the appropriate encryption module. North
   American and Canadian users will receive the 448 bit Blowfish encryption 
   module. Users outside of North America, will receive the 48 bit DES 
   encryption module.

   IDK Inc. is in the process of obtaining a crypto export license to allow
   export of the stronger Blowfish encryption module to users outside North
   America.  KeyRing/2 already contains a migration path from DES to 
   Blowfish - If you start out with DES encryption, you will be able to 
   upgrade to Blowfish for free - if and when we receive US Government 
   approval to export the stronger encryption version.

   Send an Email to IDK, Inc. and provide us your snail mail address.  We will
   send you the (small) encryption module as an email attachment, upon 
   verification of your address. North American users must not export the 
   Blowfish encryption module outside the USA and Canada.

11. Note: The first time you run KeyRing/2, it may ask you to supply a 
registration code to activate your key file. Your registration code is found 
in the KeyRing/2 Information folder.  Double click on the Registration Code 
icon to view the code.  Cut and paste the 16 character code into the 
KeyRing/2 registration code dialog box when asked.  This code is NOT your 
master password!

12. Read the manual found in the KeyRing/2 desktop folder for further 
information. 

13. If KeyRing/2 complains about a missing VROBJ.DLL, then copy the enclosed
VROBJ.DLL to your D:\OS2\DLL directory.  Replace "D:" with your OS/2 boot 
drive letter. VROBJ.DLL is used by a wide variety of software, so don't 
delete it if you uninstall KeyRing/2.

14. You may safely erase KR2.WPI after installation. You can download a new
copy from the Internet or use your installation floppies to recreate this 
file.

Note: If this is an unregistered demo version, your database files will
have a maximum lifetime of 30 days. After 30 days your database will "go to 
sleep" until you register.  You can create new database files with KeyRing/2 
to "restart the clock". Registration will allow you access to your expired
database files, if any.



**********************************************************************
                           Warning!
Resetting your computer clock will make the demo version of KeyRing/2 
inoperative and your database files inaccessible.
**********************************************************************

After you register, you *may* change your computer clock without harming 
KeyRing/2. 

Contact IDK, Inc. for a special registration key if you would like to 
evaluate KeyRing/2 in a mobile environment where it is necessary to change 
the computer clock.

--------------
Deinstallation
--------------

Note: You do not need to deinstall to upgrade.  

1. Open your WarpIN folder

2. Start WarpIN by double clicking on the WarpIN icon.

3. Select the KeyRing/2 packages you want to deinstall with your mouse. Be 
   careful not to delete any other software you have installed with WarpIN 
   that you don't want to deinstall.

4. Right-click on a selected package and then click on the Deinstall menu 
   item.  WarpIN will remove the files and the KeyRing/2 folder from your 
   desktop.

For safety reasons, deinstallation does not remove your KR2.INI file 
(contains setup information) and any PWX (encrypted database files full 
of your secrets).  It also does not delete any MSX files that contain 
language internationalization information. 

After deinstallation is complete you can manually shred the KR2 directory 
folder to delete any remaining files.


Thank you for trying KeyRing/2!
